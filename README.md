# Web Application Development with Flask

## Overview

This repository contains the learning materials and exercises for the "Web Application Development with Flask" quest from StackUp's "Developing Web Applications with Flask" campaign. The goal of this quest is to help you create more routes and pages, use Jinja templating for dynamic pages, and develop a templated web app.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this quest, you will be able to:
- Create more routes and pages in a Flask application.
- Use Jinja templating to generate dynamic web pages.
- Develop a templated web application.

## Quest Details

### Introduction

In this quest, you will build upon your basic Flask web application by adding more pages and creating dynamic content with Jinja templating. Jinja provides a powerful way to generate HTML dynamically, allowing you to separate presentation and application logic effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository and switch to the `main2` branch:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ckabuo/Developing-Web-Applications-with-Flask.git
    cd Developing-Web-Applications-with-Flask
    git checkout -b main2
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application
1. Run the Flask application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the application in action. Refresh the page to see updates, and use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server when needed.
